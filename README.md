# dom-doll

A nano Javascript lib to enchant the HTML DOM.

:warning: While the doll character (`$`) looks a lot like the dollar character (`$`), dom-doll doesn't try to mimic jQuery.
It makes jQuery useless in some new small projects but is neither a viable replacement in an already working application nor an alternative designed to please jQuery users or be easy to learn knowing jQuery.


*nano documentation of the doll function incoming*
